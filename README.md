# Sunlight-Intensity-Monitoring-System

## Objective
The objective of the project is to build the monitoring system which will continuously keep track of the sunlight falling on the plants each day so that an individual can take further steps to ensure the health of the plants in the garden.

## Hardware Required:
1. Light dependent resistor (LDR)
2. Wi-fi module
3. Resistor (10 ohm)
4. Breadboard


## Methodology
This IoT device is placed in the garden to measure the intensity of sunlight by the LDR sensor, then data will be sent to the cloud where we will analyse the data in the form of line graph. Then we will download the data in csv format and we will apply the visualization technique to obtain some insights from the data.

## About Boltâ€™s cloud platform
Its control panel provides us the user access management system which enables us to monitor and control the IoT devices. The wifi module is connected to the bolt cloud, which will stores the data received from the sensor and helps us to visualize the data in the form of line graph
